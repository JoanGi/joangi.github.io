I'm a researcher specializing in data-sharing techniques for machine learning, with a focus on the human aspects of software engineering. I consider software and data to be sociotechnical assets, and I am committed to bridging the gap between them and society. I'm currently involved in [Croissant](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant/), a metadata initiative for AI-ready datasets, where I'm co-leading the Responsible AI group. Additionally, I'm currently developing machine learning techniques that benefit the greater good, alongside humanities and social scientists at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. Furthermore, I have taught, created course content, and coordinated practicums for web and software development courses at UAB and UOC universities. Previously, I worked as a software architect for international companies, and I was elected to the [Catalan Parliament](https://www.parlament.cat/web/composicio/diputats-fitxa/index.html?p_codi=1851&p_legislatura=11) (2015-2018), serving as a spokesman in its Science and Technology Committee.
