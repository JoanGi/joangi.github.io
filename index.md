I'm a researcher who focuses on improving data practices for fair and trustworthy machine learning. I'm interested in the intersection of data engineering and society, as well as how the new AI regulation will affect how we develop ML applications. I'm currently involved in the [Croissant Responsible AI extension](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant/), which is a community-led project led by the MLCommons consortium to standardize data-sharing practices for machine learning. I have taught, created course content, and coordinated practicums for web and software development courses at UAB and UOC. Previously, I worked as a software architect for international companies, and I was elected to the [Catalan Parliament](https://www.parlament.cat/web/composicio/diputats-fitxa/index.html?p_codi=1851&p_legislatura=11) (2015-2018) and served as the Science and Technology Committee's spokesman.
